# Avast Antivirus JavaScript Interpreter

The main Avast antivirus process is called AvastSvc.exe, which runs as SYSTEM.

![AvastSvc.exe](doc/avastsvc.png)

That service loads the low level antivirus engine, and analyzes untrusted data
received from sources like the filesystem minifilter or intercepted network
traffic.

Despite being highly privileged and processing untrusted input by design, it is
unsandboxed and has poor mitigation coverage. Any vulnerabilities in this
process are critical, and easily accessible to remote attackers.

So.. maybe not great that it includes a custom JavaScript interpreter....????

This repository contains an interactive shell that lets you test the
interpreter on Linux for vulnerability research.

# Building

Here's how to try it out, first install the dependencies.

#### Ubuntu
```
$ sudo apt install libreadline-dev:i386 libc6-dev-i386 gcc-multilib
```

#### Fedora
```
$ sudo yum install readline-devel.i686 glibc-devel.i686 libgcc.i686
```

Now you can clone this repository.

```
$ git cloneÂ https://github.com/taviso/loadlibrary.git
$ cd loadlibrary
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If everything looks good, build it and `avscript` should be ready.

```
$ make
```

# Notes

###  Reproducing Vulnerabilities on Windows

For performance reasons, Avast do not interpret every JavaScript file they
encounter, they use a heuristic to determine if it's necessary. I've found that
appending the file `javascript.txt` included in this repository is enough to
always trigger the heuristic.

For example, if you have found a vulnerability and want to reproduce it on
Windows, you would first do this:

```
$ cat yourtestcase.js javascript.txt > ReproForWindows.js
```

### Protected Process

The Avast service is a protected process, which means debugging it from
userspace is tricky. If you have kd configured, you can simply undo this
and then debugging in userspace works fine.

### Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability, it is likely critical and wormable, and should be
[reported](https://www.avast.com/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure) urgently.
